About Deque Systems:

Website accessibility is both our mission and our passion and something we have been doing for over ten years with major corporations, government agencies, and other organizations. Every Deque team member – some of whom have been with the company since it was founded in 1999 – is passionate about the importance of accessibility in the digital world and in helping customers achieve the outcomes that accessibility provides. Our culture focuses heavily on these key pillars, in hiring, evaluation, and career paths. 

At its core, Deque is a website accessibility company that is inventive. The company invented the first accessibility plug-in software, the first web-based testing platform, and the first server-based accessibility solution. All of these have been created in the service of helping our customers become accessible, advance the goals of their organization, and remove barriers for all users on the web.
