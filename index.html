<a id="accessible-ios-form-validation" class="anchor" href="#accessible-ios-form-validation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Accessible iOS Form Validation</h1>

<p>Handling form error validation correctly is important. It is typically the first thing users see (like a login screen), or is involved in essential use case paths. Most apps that involve a form of some kind don’t want the error requirements, frequently highlighted in red, to be messing up the visual appearance of their app. Instead, specific requirements are denoted by asterisks, hint text, or some requirements are just assumed. Only when users fail to make this assumption are they assaulted with error messages and bright red text. From a sighted users point of view, this user experience is fine! However, from an Accessibility point of view, we have broken two critical requirements. First, addition of dynamic content (the addition of the error labels) and second color is being used as information (the color of the labels is drawing attention to the fact that they are errors). The goal of this post is to cover how to take this approach, and make it accessible in iOS.</p>

<p>This discussion will frequently reference code in the open source repository. Note that the information from this post was gathered using an iPad (8.1.3) and iPod Touch (8.1.2). If any mentioned behaviors/bugs have changed, feel free to leave a comment and I will update as necessary, and do my best to check back now and then myself.</p>

<h2>
<a id="pre-submission" class="anchor" href="#pre-submission" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Pre Submission</h2>

<p>Before we submit the forms we have the following setup:</p>

<p><img src="http://s6.postimg.org/mdscdi6ip/iosformpresubmission.png" alt="A screenshot of an iOS Application with a basic form.  Deque Logo at the top, with 3 text fields for name, email address and date.  A submit button at the bottom."></p>

<p>State of app prior to form submission.The most obvious change from the standard approach is the light grey background. The traditional thin rounded border is difficult for users with mild sight impairments to see. By providing UITextFields a light grey background we ensure the bounds are easy to spot.</p>

<p>Then notice how we have the “Name:” field set up. If you look at our story board files, you should see that the AccessibilityLabel is set to “Name” (thus avoiding the readout of the “:”) and the hint is set up to read “This field is required.” In VoiceOver the entire UITextField, when focused, should announced like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Name, text field (pause) This field is required. Double tap to edit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice the pause before reading “This field is required.” This is beneficial. When setting up accessibility for applications, always keep two users in mind: power users and new users. Labels provide instant, important information that even the users most familiar with your application need to orient themselves. No matter how familiar a VoiceOver user is with your application, they may not know where focus originated, and so they need labels like “Name” and “Email” to keep them oriented within your application. However, that a particular field is required, or even that it is a text entry field, is something that they will become accustomed to over time. So having the pause before sharing that it is required is good! It also allows us to differentiate between this version, and the “Post Submission” version of the view, to make this information more apparent to users who fail to submit the form properly.</p>

<p>Notice our Date field is marked up very different from our Email field. We have a more complex requirement for it, namely the mm/dd/yyyy date formatting. A popular approach is to replicate the Android “Hint” text, where we place the formatting requirements directly into the UITextField as placeholder text. However, this placeholder text will ultimately be replaced. So a UITextField that was first read out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Date, mm/dd/yyyy … (btw, the read out of yyyy without spaces is harsh!)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gets read out like this after text entry</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Date, “(entered text)” …</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the proper date formatting is now lost. For sighted users, it is commonly available elsewhere on the app, but for non-sighted users it is frequently lost for good. We remedy this situation by separating the two labels for sighted and non-sighted users. We place the labeling for sighted users in with the “Date” UILabel. We then set the hint on the UITextField to “m m / d d / y y y y, this field is required.” for non sighted users. Notice the extra spaces. This causes VO to readout the letters more concisely. Otherwise individual letters aren’t pronounced well.</p>

<p>Finally, we go through and turn off isAccessibiltyElement for all UI elements that are not either our UITextFields or the submit button. All of the information VoiceOver users need is in the label or hint of the given elements. Focusing the UILabels would be distracting and confusing.</p>

<p>Post Submission Here is what the view likes after we attempt to submit the form, without anything filled out:</p>

<p><img src="http://s9.postimg.org/eh9vx4f5r/iosformpostsubmission.png" alt="An image of an iOS View, the same view as in the other image, but after unsuccessful form submission.  Deque logo at the top, with three text entry fields, denoting space for name, email adress, and date.  There are error messages in red text below each field, because the text fields were left empty."></p>

<p>State of app after unsuccessful form submission.From a visual standpoint, obviously things have changed. We now see error messages below the UITextFields. However, what is more important is what happens with VoiceOver turned on.</p>

<p>First, let’s talk about the easy stuff. That is, removing the hints, and placing the text that was in the hint, directly into the label. So, if VoiceOver’s original read out for the Name field was this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Name, text field (pause) This field is required. Double tap to edit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now it is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Name, This field is required. text field (pause) Double tap to edit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This subtle change helps VoiceOver users be aware of the fact that there are requirements on those fields. If the hint text was ignored before, it is now more difficult to ignore! Notice, that the text of the hint has not changed. Changing the content of the text would be jarring, we are just placing the text in a place where it is more obvious. The subtle change also hints to what is wrong. If requirement messages are attached to labels for fields that weren’t correctly filled out, and that information is left in the hint for fields that were, it provides clues as to which fields are problematic. All without changing any of the actual content!</p>

<p>Finally, we want VoiceOver to place focus on the first element (in order from the beginning of the content to the end) that failed validation. So, in this case, the first focused element would be the Name UITextField. However, if a name were provided, VoiceOver focus would be placed on the Email UITextField. To do this we use the following line of code</p>

<p><code>UIAccessibilityPostNotification(UIAccessibilityLayoutChangedNotification, _nameField);</code></p>

<p>This notification tells VoiceOver to send AccessibilityFocus to the _nameField. When focus changes, the label of the new element is read out (not the hint, see alternate design decisions below), and the black VoiceOver box is moved to the element. We move it to the first failing element so that as they flip forward through the remaining items, they will easily find the other items that have failed.</p>

<h2>
<a id="alternate-design-decisions" class="anchor" href="#alternate-design-decisions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Alternate Design Decisions</h2>

<p>There are a few other ways we could have done this. I would just like to spend a little bit talking about these design decisions, and why we chose this as the “best” way to do this.</p>

<h3>
<a id="layout-notification-bug" class="anchor" href="#layout-notification-bug" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Layout Notification Bug</h3>

<p>One of the possible ways to handle dynamic content, such as form error validation, is to announce that content has been added to the page. In fact, iOS supports such notifications. Instead of supplying a UIObject to the post notification call we could have done this:</p>

<p><code>UIAccessibilityPostNotification(UIAccessibilityLayoutChangedNotification, @“For submission failed, check ##### element”);</code></p>

<p>This should then cause VoiceOver to announce the provided string. However, this behavior is bugged in at least iOS 8.1.3 and prior. So, obviously, this approach isn’t going to work. We could instead use the screen changed notification, which provides a similar behavior, but is NOT bugged:</p>

<p>UIAccessibilityPostNotification(UIAccessibilityScreenChangedNotification, @“For submission failed, check ##### element”);</p>

<p>However, the screen change notification comes with the little “beep-boop” that notifies VoiceOver users that they have changed screens. Hence, “ScreenChangedNotification”. This is an misleading representation of what has happened. Ultimately a combination of the two solutions would be best, but given the current framework bugs, we believe our solution to find a good balance.</p>

<h3>
<a id="leave-info-in-the-hint" class="anchor" href="#leave-info-in-the-hint" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Leave Info in the Hint</h3>

<p>Another alternative would be to leave the UITextField accessibility information alone. Instead of moving the AccessibilityHint information onto the end of the AccessibilityLabel, just leave it be!</p>

<p>This is a reasonable solution, except for one little flaw. When you use the UIAccessibilityLayoutChangedNotification, to move focus to the first failing element, only the AccessibilityLabel for that element is read out.</p>

<p>Name, text field (pause) This field is required. Double tap to edit.</p>

<p>The bolded portion is left off! If what we aim to do is draw attention to the errors, this is obviously not ideal.</p>

<p>Conclusion Thanks for reading. If you have any questions, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:chris.mcmeeking@deque.com">chris.mcmeeking@deque.com</a>. Look for a post on the same topic, from the Android point of view in the next couple of weeks!</p>
